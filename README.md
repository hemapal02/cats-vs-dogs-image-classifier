🐱🐶 Cats vs Dogs Image Classifier

This is a deep learning model that can look at a photo and tell whether it’s a cat or a dog. It’s built using Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and trained on real image data. Perfect for beginners who want to learn computer vision and deep learning.

📌 What This Project Does
Takes an image as input (either a cat or a dog).

Predicts whether the image contains a cat or a dog.

Shows the prediction with confidence score.

Includes a simple Streamlit web app to try it out easily.

🎯 Goal
To understand how image classification works using deep learning, and to practice building, training, and deploying a model from scratch.

🧠 Tech Used
Python 🐍

TensorFlow / Keras (for model building)

OpenCV / PIL (for image handling)

Streamlit (for building the web app)

Google Colab (for training the model using GPU)

📁 Dataset
We used the Dogs vs Cats dataset from Kaggle.

25,000 images total

12,500 cat images 🐱

12,500 dog images 🐶

🚀 How to Run
🔧 1. Clone the repo
bash
